# Coding Assignment
The goal of this assignment is to showcase your ability to develop features and your coding style. Due to the time constraint you will have to prioritize what you work on, and have to try and balance cleanliness with just getting it done.

Even though the app is small, one can easily spend the whole week working on it: perfecting styles, testing every single method, or carefully crafting every single line of code. Please don't! Do as much as you can in about two hours and share the results.

The most important part of the interview will come after this one, when we look at the app together, talk about the decisions you have made, etc..

## Ticketing managing application

Build a ticket managing app, where the user can add, filter, assign, and complete tickets.

* The app should have two screens: the list screen and the details screen. Please use the React Router to manage the transitions between them.
* You can use any state management library you want (or none at all). e.g. Redux, MobX, or just React context + providers.
* Write a couple of tests. The goal here is not to build a production-quality app, so don't test every single detail. Two or three tests should be good enough.
* Don't forget about error handling and race conditions. The API server has a random delay. If you bump it up to say 10 seconds, would the app still work correctly?

## Submitting your solution

Please send us the link to your Stackblitz fork. We will continue to work on it during the pair-programming sessions. Please also indicate approximately how long you spent on the submission.
